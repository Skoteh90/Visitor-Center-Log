# Visitor-Center-Log
Web application that renders a 3D globe populated with pins highlighting hometowns of visitors whom visit the visitor's center.

- User types in the name of a location and the app auto completes possible locations.
- When location is confirmed a pin at the correct latitude and longitude is added to the globe.
- Information about the location and who added it is available by clicking on the pin.
- Geolocation was accomplished with an offline database of locations to remove the need of a dedicated internet connection.
- All users and locations are saved to an external file available for data analysis.
